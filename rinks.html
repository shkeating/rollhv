                <a href="https://skatetimeny.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Skate Time</a> is a 21st
                century constructed rink with great personality, in house DJs, a the <a

                    team</a>,
                and the nicest skating surface in the Hudson Valley. Staffed by skaters and <a

                so good
                you'll arrive hungry on purpose. Only gripe I have is the DJ does not take requests. An absolute must
                visit if shuffle skating is of interest to you!

                <a href="https://www.woodnwheel.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wood N Wheel</a> is a
                birthday party facility that happens
                to have a vintage roller rink. It has a lot more activities for kids on site, but it is not to be
                overlooked, especially if you hold an interest in figures. It is the only rink in our immediate
                geographic area with lines for figures printed onto the rink. A true gem if you catch it at the right
                time of day. Occassionally offers adult nights.

                A once highly regarded spot for the roller skating community, <a href="https://rollermagichydepark.com/"
                    target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hyde Park Roller Magic</a> has had a
                tumultuous couple of
                years and was listed for sale in June of 2024. Currently its future is unclear, and the floor and
                facilitiy are in need of maintenence and renovation. In the meantime, it's still operating and the
                only rink on the east side of the river. It's worth the visit if the location is convienent to you. This
                rink is also notably home of the <a href="https://www.horrorsrollerderby.com/" target="_blank"
                    rel="noopener noreferrer">Hudson Valley Horrors</a>, a WTFDA league roller derby team.
